What does hoisting mean and what does it do? Think if it like opening a book with multiple chapters. One of the first pages in the book might be an index or table of contents with a list of the various chapters you might find. We can look at this page to get an idea of what information nwe can expect to find in the book later.

Hoisitng does this in a similar way. There are two phases that happen when we run our code:
 - Creation phase: any variable (var, let, const) and function in our code are stored in memory.
  - Execution phase: Values are assigned to the variables and functions that are in memory during the create phaswe

  let variable = 'value
;
